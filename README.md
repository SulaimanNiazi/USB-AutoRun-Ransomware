# USB-AutoRun-Ransomware

**A Python-based ransomware simulator for educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes**

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This project demonstrates how a USB-based executable can simulate ransomware behavior in a safe, controlled, and non-destructive manner. It is designed for:

- Cybersecurity education and awareness
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing training
- Demonstrations in classrooms or workshops on ransomware tactics
- Showcasing system vulnerability via USB autorun payloads (historically exploitable)

## 🚨 WARNING

> **This project is for educational use only.**

- It does not perform any real malicious actions like stealing data or spreading.
- It **simulates** encryption by modifying dummy files and displaying a mock lock screen.
- Misuse of this tool outside educational environments may violate laws or institutional policies.

You are fully responsible for how you use this software.

**Do not forget the unlock key!** If the key is lost or forgotten, only a **power reset (reboot)** will end the simulation. However, the encrypted files will remain locked.

To decrypt them, use the open-source Python decryption tool available here:

## 🚀 How It Works

When a USB containing the executable and `autorun.inf` is inserted (on systems that still support autorun), the program:

1. Creates `README.txt` warning files on the Desktop, Documents, and Downloads folders.
2. Simulates encryption of a dummy folder using symmetric encryption.
3. Displays a fullscreen lock screen demanding a key.
4. Blocks certain system keys like `Windows` and `Alt` to simulate lock-down.
5. Requests **administrator privileges** automatically on launch for full functionality (e.g. Task Manager lockout).

> Note: Autorun is disabled by default on modern Windows versions. Manual execution may be required.

To use the USB feature effectively:

- Copy the contents of this repository (especially `autorun.inf` and the `.exe` file) onto the **root of a USB drive**.
- On legacy Windows systems that support autorun, inserting the USB will auto-execute the ransomware demo.
- On modern systems, the executable must be manually run from the USB.

## 📦 Requirements

Before using, ensure you have:

- Python 3.7+
- `cryptography` library
- `keyboard` library
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python on Windows)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To create an executable:

```bash
python convert_py_to_exe.py
```

The `.exe` will appear in the `dist` folder. When run, it will request admin access automatically.

## 🚙 Applications

- Cybersecurity demonstrations in school/university settings
- Training exercises for red-team/blue-team environments
- Showing how unprotected USB usage can lead to security risks
- General awareness for non-technical audiences

## 🔐 Safety Precautions

- Always run this demo on test systems or virtual machines
- Do not use in production or live environments
- Ensure sensitive data is not present in the test folder (`Dummy folder`)
- Clearly inform users this is a **simulation** before running
- Administrator permissions may be requested to demonstrate full effect
- **Antivirus software will likely detect and delete `ransomware.py` or the compiled `.exe`.**
  - This is due to behavior that mimics real malware (fullscreen lock, encryption simulation, key blocking)
  - For proper testing, temporarily **disable antivirus or add an exclusion** for the test folder
  - Do this only on **safe, isolated systems**, such as offline virtual machines
